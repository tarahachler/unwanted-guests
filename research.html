        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>This project began with a field research phase, where we observed a specific area of the home. It is the result of an investigation focused on the front door and the welcoming area.</p>
        <p>The research employed several techniques, some inspired by <a href="https://www.nicolasnova.net/">Nicolas Nova</a>'s book <a href="https://mobile.payot.ch/Detail/exercices_dobservation-nicolas_nova-9782850611414?cId=0">Exercices d'observation</a>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Drawings</li>
            <li>Interviews</li>
            <li>Quantitative data collection</li>
            <li>Mind maps</li>
            <li>Keywords</li>
            <li>Graphs</li>
            <li>Documentation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These methods were used to explore and deepen our understanding of two main questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How do we interact with the entry space and the front door?</li>
            <li>How does the act of welcoming shape our experience of being together?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The research started with observational drawings of the front door from various perspectives. This included sketches of typical entryway objects—shoes, a doormat, the doorbell—and details of the entrance itself.</p>
        <p>In parallel, I investigated the definitions, symbolism, and themes surrounding doors and the concept of welcoming.</p>
        <p>I also categorized and named different aspects of the front door, looking at it from multiple angles.</p>
        <p>I became particularly interested in daily habits—the automatic actions we perform. I noticed that while everyone in my home followed a similar routine when entering, the sequence of actions was unique to each individual.</p>
        <p>Expanding my observations, I sketched people interacting with doors around Geneva, capturing moments of entry and exit. The energy in these interactions inspired me to rethink how to represent this experience.</p>
        <p>To deepen my understanding, I interviewed two people living in the same home, discussing their perceptions of welcoming and being welcomed:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>"I open the door, but I keep my hand on it. Just in case? It's not conscious, I think. Once it's clear, I’ll step out toward the mail carrier—I don’t want them coming in."</li>
            <li>"There’s this floating moment, like... I find it’s not such an obvious thing. There’s also a bit of stress. Like, I want them to take off their shoes."</li>
            <li>"At least they don’t both jump on us at once. It’s really nice—it’s just one of them that comes, not both. It gives us time to settle in. They’re not stressed either."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Finally, I explored the symbolism of the front door through texts and metaphors about entry, exit, and passage.</p>
