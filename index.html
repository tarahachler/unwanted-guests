                <p><strong>Selena Murphy</strong></p>
                <p>Light sleeper</p>
                <img src="img/selena.JPG" alt="Selena Murphy">
                <p>Wakes up ridiculously easily – the second you step inside and make even the tiniest noise. Hair looks like it’s fighting gravity, with a perfect pillow crease stamped across the face. Exhausted, but ready to judge you for waking them up when you get home late.</p>

            <div class="guest">
                <p><strong>Raymond Pickett</strong></p>
                <p>Oddball</p>
                <img src="img/raymond.JPG" alt="Raymond Pickett">
                <p>Always ready to drop the most useless, outdated fun facts – usually with exact dates no one asked for. The kind of friend you grow weirdly attached to, despite knowing you’ll get random trivia about 18th-century spoons mid-conversation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="guest">
                <p><strong>Théodore de Montfaucon</strong></p>
                <p>Visitor from another era</p>
                <img src="img/theodore.JPG" alt="Théodore de Montfaucon">
                <p>A fiercely devoted French revolutionary, Théodore has stumbled into the modern world - and he’s not impressed. He greets you like a knight, politely disturbed by your “magic lanterns” (light bulbs). He quickly loses patience and calls you an “infamous scoundrel” when you cross his path.</p>

            <div class="guest">
                <p><strong>Hugo</strong></p>
                <p>Chill master</p>
                <img src="img/hugo.JPG" alt="Hugo">
                <p>Permanently horizontal, Hugo moves at the speed of a Sunday afternoon. Always cradling hemp tea, he radiates the kind of calm that makes deadlines irrelevant. Work? That’s a future-you problem. His presence alone feels like a permission slip to chill and forget responsibility exists.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="guest">
                <p><strong>Émile Brouillard</strong></p>
                <p>Puzzle trickster</p>
                <img src="img/gaston.JPG" alt="Gaston Elmaleh">
                <p>Greets you with riddles that make no sense – half the words mysteriously whited out. Every visit feels like cracking a bizarre code. Are they messing with you or is there actually a deeper meaning? Either way, Émile’s absurd enigmas turn opening the door into an unpredictable adventure.</p>
